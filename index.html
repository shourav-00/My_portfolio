            <p>I'm a passionate Computer Science student on a journey to explore and master the world of technology. In my first year, I learned C and C++ and began solving problems on platforms like BeeCrowd, Codeforces, and LeetCode. In my second year, I started learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and recently, I’ve taken my first steps into Web Development — building a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. I’m committed to growing as a programmer and reaching my long-term goal of working in a top tech company. I’m always curious, always learning — and this is just the beginning.</p>

            <h3 id="c">What I do</h3>
            <p>I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Daffodil International University. In my first and early second year, I explored various areas of tech to find what truly excites me. I’ve learned programming languages like C, C++, and Java, and practiced problem-solving on platforms like BeeCrowd, Codeforces, and LeetCode. I'm deeply interested in Machine Learning and plan to pursue it strongly in the future, with the goal of working at an M.Tech-level company.

Currently, I’m focusing on Web Development to build practical skills and gain internship opportunities. While the path is challenging, I believe in consistent hard work — and that’s what drives me forward.

                    <p class="skill-des">I started my programming journey with the C language, which gave me a strong foundation in programming logic and structure. I learned how to use variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays efficiently. C helped me understand how memory management works using pointers. I’ve also solved various basic and intermediate problems to build my problem-solving skills. This experience with C has strengthened my logic and made it easier to learn other languages like C++ and Java.</p>

                    <p class="skill-des">I learned Java to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in a real-world context. Through Java, I practiced core concepts like classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces. I also learned how to structure programs using packages and how to handle input/output operations. Java’s simplicity and platform independence made it easier to build small-scale projects and understand application-level programming. This language helped me connect theory with practical coding and improved my programming mindset overall.</p>

                        <p>I’ve started exploring Machine Learning to understand how data-driven models can solve real-world problems. I’ve learned the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, and studied common algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering. I’m familiar with using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for building simple ML models. This field matches my interest in logic, data, and math, and I aim to deepen my ML knowledge to pursue opportunities in high-level tech companies. It’s one of my long-term goals to become strong in this domain.</p>

                        <p>Mathematics plays a vital role in shaping how I think and solve problems. It taught me patience, precision, and logical reasoning — skills that influence every part of my learning journey. More than a subject, math became a mindset that helps me approach challenges with clarity and confidence.</p>
